"Hey Researchers! We know that research can be a lot to handle, but that doesn't mean you have to sacrifice your well-being. 

Here are some tips to help boost your productivity while still taking care of yourself:

✅Set clear goals: Break down your research into manageable tasks and set specific deadlines for each one.

✅Prioritize: Tackle the most important tasks first, and don't be afraid to say no to less important requests.

✅Take regular breaks: It's important to take a step back and give your mind and body a break. Take a walk, stretch, or engage in an activity you enjoy.

✅Engage in self-care activities: Whether it's meditation, yoga, or spending time with loved ones, make sure you're taking time for yourself.

➡➡At RESEARCHPRENEURS, we understand the importance of self-care and professional development for researchers. That's why we'll be sharing more tips and resources to help you thrive in your research and career.

"Have you ever wondered about the effectiveness of carbon offset credits? 🤔 

A new investigation into the world's leading carbon standard provider has found that over 90% of the rainforest offset credits commonly used by companies may be ""phantom credits"" and do not actually represent genuine carbon reductions. 📑 

❓ This raises important questions about the validity of offsets as part of a company's net zero strategy and the responsibilities of companies making environmental claims.

"What is your experience with IP so far? 

➡As a service provider, we are not only serious about protecting our client's intellectual property (IP) as part of our service, we are also continuously working to safeguard our own IP generated by 
our researchers.

Safeguarding IP is much easier in the beginning phases of a business than after those ideas have become successful. As we continue to improve our operations, the need to properly manage and think about IP becomes more pressing. 💡 This is why we decided to share a few points with you on how to protect your IP.

So what is intellectual property (IP)?

Here are 6 ways to protect your IP:

✅ Copyright Registration
✅ Application for a Patent or Provisional Patent
✅ Trademark Registration
✅ Opt for a Contract of Ownership
✅ Publishing it Widely with Attribution
✅ Tight Security Controls

✴ Dear RESEARCHPRENEURS, please keep in mind that IP rights are key economic assets in today's knowledge economy. That's why startups and SMEs need to build an IP strategy. Not to mention that IP is a key consideration for investors that will boost your investment opportunities if done right.

When you're connecting two worlds as RESEARCHPRENEURS, researchers and startups, you network twice as hard.

The summit was a learning experience for all of us and now is the time to apply technology to create products that solve issues.

Our startup was marked as one “making a difference around the world” 🎉. 
You, too, can make a difference and it's time to put your brilliant ideas into action:

Are you a researcher looking for opportunities outside academia and are you determined to make an immediate impact and implementation of your ideas?  ➡Send us a message with code “Researcher”

Or are you a startup with ground-breaking ideas to bring to market and now looking for deep minds and research-driven expertise to help you achieve your goals and co-create innovation. ➡  Send us a message with code “Startup”

"Let's have a look at the World Economic Forum's ""Top 10 In-Demand Skills for 2025.""  What do we notice? 🤔 

Only 20% of those on this list are focusing on hard skills, specifically tech-related skills. The remaining 80% are focused on soft skills, including problem-solving, self-management, and collaboration. What more could we be missing? 🔍 

In any case, the three categories of soft skills are intrinsically linked to self-knowledge, strategic thinking, creativity, emotional resilience, and intelligence. We're sharing this list with you today because we're certain of the value it brings to both researchers and entrepreneurs. Likewise, our sister startup QMindness also helps to improve soft skills, check their 🌐 website www.qmindness.com ⬅ and register for QM Masterminds.

We can reach our full potential and achieve our goals by choosing to take charge of our growth and development. It's also worth noting that personal development is an ongoing process. It is never too late! 🤩 

⭐ As the world progresses, the demand for problem-solving, critical thinking, and technological knowledge has never been greater. Whether you are in academia, an entrepreneur, or in any other field, you will find those skills beneficial.

"Why do we encourage mutually beneficial collaborations between researchers and startups? 🎯

As our founder Alevtina Evgrafova, PhD, ACC ICF says, the potential and outcomes of collaboration between researchers and startups are undervalued. 

By collaborating with researchers, startups benefit from a fresh outlook on existing product and feature development, as well as researcher-based product description or due diligence can be arranged. 📈 How does it sound?

What is the ""catch"" for researchers? Having experience outside academia is extremely beneficial for either maintaining leading roles in research or as a step towards a possible transfer into R&D industry employment or even more ambitious goals like starting a researcher-owned business. Exciting, isn't it?

✅ #researchpreneurs ensures that researchers and startups connect and collaborate efficiently towards impact innovations. 
✅ While QMindness ensures a smooth onboarding process and productive teamwork through professional and tailored coaching and training.
