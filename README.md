## Project Description

This project aims to analyze the Twitter content of competitors to help ResearchPreneurs in developing their content marketing strategies. The approach is to identify the common topics that these companies usually talk about, and then see how well those topics perform based on the available metrics such as views, replies, and retweets. This information can then be used to inform RP's own content strategy, helping them to create content that is more likely to engage their audience and achieve their marketing goals.
